    <P><strong>Abraham Benjamin</strong><strike> de Villiers</strike>
        <insert>devil</insert><em> (born 17 February 1984) </em>is a South African former<mark> international cricketer.</mark> He is regarded as one of the greatest batters of his generation.[2] de Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year three times
        during his <b>15-year</b> international career.[3] He was one of the five Wisden cricketers of the decade at the end of
        <delete>2019.</delete>[4] He began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batter, but he has most often played only as a batter. Regarded as one of the most <sub>innovative</sub> and<sup> destructive,</sup> batsmen in the modern era, de Villiers
        is known for a range of <u>unorthodox shots</u>, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.[5] He made his international <mark>debut in a Test match against England in 2004 </mark> first played a One Day International (ODI) in early 2005. His debut
        in Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket and is one of the very few batsmen to have a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the game.[6] In limited overs cricket, he is an
        attacking player.[7] He holds the record for the fastest ODI fifty<mark>(16 balls)</mark> equalled by Matthew Forde of the West Indies<br> who made 58 off 19 balls against Ireland [8], fastest ODI century (31 balls), and fastest ODI 150 (62 balls)
        De Villiers captained South Africa in all three formats,<big> although after a series of injuries, he stepped down from the Test captaincy.<big></big> In 2017,<small> he stepped down from captaining the national limited-overs games</small></P>
