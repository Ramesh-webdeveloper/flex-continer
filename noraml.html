    <h2>What is E-commerce Content?</h2>
    <p>E-commerce content is the list of various materials intended to attract potential buyers. Brands create content to present information through many channels and mediums.</p>
    <h2>What are the Elements of E-Commerce Content?</h2>
    <h2>title</h2>
    <p>It's crucial to understand that title is part of your content too. The title provides a significant value <br> to search engines. But that's not all; titles help you attract potential customers and shine from the crowd.</p>
    <h2>images</h2>
    <p>E-commerce content does not only comprise written pieces but images too. Images don't only attract viewers but boost the understanding
        <br>of the material too. Pictures speak global languages of visuals. It rapidly conveys the message and emotion.</p>
    <h2>Videos</h2>
    <p>Diversify your content and add a little bit of video to it. You can represent your product's functionality with short videos.
        <br> E.g., let 's say you are selling a hat, shoot a short video with a hat on and express what it can add to the overall look.</p>
    <h2>360 Views</h2>
    <p>No dark side of the moon for your selling items. You should display your product with 360 views to let your visitors explore the full angle of the product. </p>
    <h2>Product Reviews</h2>
    <p>Many companies write product reviews to cut the buyers' concerns and help them get the best out of the product.</p>
    <h2>Product Comparisons</h2>
    <p>Buyers' actions differ from each other. Some find it simple to make decisions, but others are in two minds about it.<br> So product comparisons bring together people on the fence and guide them to the final stage. In this manner, the brand acts as
        a friend of the visitor, helping them in tough times.</p>
    <h2>Product Listing</h2>
    <p>A product page defines the details of a specific product. It could be</p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Features</li>
